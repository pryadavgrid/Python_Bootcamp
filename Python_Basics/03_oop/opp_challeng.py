# Object Oriented Programming Challenge
# For this challenge, create a bank account class that has two attributes:

# owner
# balance
# and two methods:

# deposit
# withdraw
# As an added requirement, withdrawals may not exceed the available balance.

# Instantiate your class, make several deposits and withdrawals, and test to make sure the account can't be overdrawn.

class Account:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, ammount):
        self.balance = self.balance + ammount
        return "Deposit Accepted"
    
    def withdraw(self, ammount):
        if self.balance >= ammount:
            self.balance = self.balance - ammount
            return "Withdraw Accepted"
        else:
            return "Fund Unavailable"
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Account owner: {self.owner}\nAccount balance: ₹{self.balance}"


# 1. Instantiate the class
acct1 = Account('Jose',100)
# 2. Print the object
print(acct1)
# Account owner:   Jose
# Account balance: $100


# 3. Show the account owner attribute
print(acct1.owner)
# 'Jose'


# 4. Show the account balance attribute
print(acct1.balance)
# 100


# 5. Make a series of deposits and withdrawals
print(acct1.deposit(50))
# Deposit Accepted


print(acct1.withdraw(75))
# Withdrawal Accepted


# 6. Make a withdrawal that exceeds the available balance
print(acct1.withdraw(500))
# Funds Unavailable!

print(acct1.balance)
